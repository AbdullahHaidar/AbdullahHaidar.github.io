            This project is intended to help coaches in the
            management of their teams work. It allows them to
            generate surveys about certain topics they are
            concerned about and possibly have great benefit for
            the overall working process. The main objectives can
            be summarized as :
        <ul>
            <li> An efficient way of managing different teams
                and keeping track of the members joined in
                every team with all information about each one
                of them.</li>
            <li> Organizing projects as subprojects and keeping
                information about each one of them.</li>
            <li>Helping the coaches understand better the state
                of their teams by asking different questions,
                which the members can reply to.</li>
            <li>Allowing coaches to test the agility of their
                teams and comparing it from team to another
                through the generated statistics.</li>
        </ul>
