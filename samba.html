A lot of emphasis has been placed on peaceful coexistence
between UNIX and Windows. Unfortunately, the two systems
come from very different cultures and they have difficulty
getting along without mediation. ...and that, of course, is
Samba's job.
</p><p>
    Samba runs on UNIX platforms, but speaks to
    Windows clients like a native. It allows a UNIX system to move
    into a Windows "Network Neighborhood" without causing a
    stir. Windows users can happily access file and print services
    without knowing or caring that those services are being offered
    by a UNIX host.
</p>
<p>
    Samba is an important component to seamlessly integrate
    Linux/Unix Servers and Desktops into Active Directory
    environments. It can function both as a domain controller and
    as a regular domain member.

    In this project a Samba server was configured and deployed to allow shared courses to be accesed by students working with different opertaing systems.
